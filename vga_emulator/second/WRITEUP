VGA "tweaked" 320x400 mode:
	+ See Chapter 31 of Abrash's "Game Programming Black Book"
	+ start with mode13h and "tweak" some settings
	+ is actually sort of the same as 320x200 in some ways, as 320x200
		mode essentially is 320x400 but with double-height pixels
	+ in tweaked mode
		lines split across 4 banks
		pixel0 -> bank0 0
		pixel1 -> bank1 0
		pixel2 -> bank2 0
		pixel3 -> bank3 0
		pixel4 -> bank0 1

	abrash sets things up:
		mov	ax,13h
		int	10h
		
		out 0x3c4,4	; SC_INDEX, MEMORY_MODE

		in  al,0x3c5
		and al,~0x8	; turn off chain 4
		or  al,0x4	; turn off odd/even
		out 0x3c5

		out 0x3ce,5	; GC_INDEX, GRAPHICS_mode
		in  al,0x3cf
		and al,~0x10	; turn off odd/even
		out 0x3cd,al

		out 0x3ce,6	; MISCELLANEOUS
		in  al, 0x3cf
		and al,~0x2	; turn off chain

		; clears it

				; do not scan twice
		out	0x3d4,9	; CRTC_INDEX,MAX_SCAN_LINE
		in	al,0x3d5
		and	al,~0x1f	; set max scaline 0
		out	0x3d5,al

		out	0x3d4,0x14	; UNDERLINE
		in	al,0x3d5
		and	al,~0x40
		out	0x3d5,al	 turn off doublewod

		out	0x3d4,0x17	; MODE CONTROL
		in	al,0x3d5
		or	al,0x40		; turn on byte mode bit
		out	0x3d5,al


JP: bouncing image

	uses 320x400 mode

	uses VGA scrolling to scroll image onto screen before launching
		into the bouncing

	scrolllock (?) enables debugging in the border

	uses hardware scrolling (?)
	massively unrolls the wiggle code (?)
		ZOOM.INC = 16k lines of generated assembly

	chunks of code not used?

To patch things so you can run them

To get it to run from the git repository:
	Copy U2.EXE to MAIN/DATA/SECOND.EXE
	Run SECOND.EXE

To patch things:
	Need to decompress twice
	UNP.EXE MAIN/DATA/JPLOGO.EXE
	UNP.EXE MAIN/DATA/JPLOGO.EXE

	run the jp_patch tool on it

	optionally run LZEXE.EXE on it to recompress?

Need to run dosbox -conf dosbox.conf which enables gus support
	the 3dsine doesn't seem to work w/o it

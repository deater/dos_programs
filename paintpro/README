Code for a paint program I wrote for my own use.

This was back in the days before I had an internet connection so I wrote
the paint program from scratch, made my own file format, and even
independently invented RLE compression.

Contents of old README.1ST

These are utilities for using the PAINTPRO image format.
They are written in turbo pascal (source included)
     and are primarily for an IBM PC compatible in 
     320x200 256 color mode (mode 13h).

The included files:
    pppview.exe    view a 320x200 file
    ppp5to6.exe    converts version 5 images to version 6
    ppptsr.exe   \ Screen capture for 320x200 ppp
    pppwrite.exe /
    pcx2ppp.exe    converts a 320x200 pcx file to ppp

The pascal files are the source.
See PAINTPRO.TXT for background/format.

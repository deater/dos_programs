This is only to be used in mode 13h (320x200 in 256 color) mode.
It is extremely inefficient and you should try to use the
pcx2ppp converter if at all possible.

It creates a 72k array in memory that does not go away until
rebooting, which can be annotin.

Baciscally, run PPPTSR.

Then  get your image on the screen.  Press "Shift-Printscreen."
Return to dos and then run the "PPPWRITE" utility.

Repeat the "shift-prtsct" "pppwrite" as often as necessary.

For unstruction press F1 while running it..
And to skip that annoying initial spinning type :
         PPRO256.exe  -     (Yep..with a minus sign after ) or
         PPRO40.EXE -
Oh yeah...also read FILE_ID.DIZ....it might help

Oh well..anyone with Pascal experince who could help improve this...
PLEASE CONTACT ME...

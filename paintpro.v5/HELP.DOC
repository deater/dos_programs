For those of you having problems with this program..
    Press F1 in the program for help.
    To get to the menus try ALT-= or Alt-F 
    Press Enter while the cursor is on the color bar to change colors.
    Type Paintpro -  (Paintpro with a minus sign) to skip the opening
         with the spinning initials.  It is too fast on some machines
         and too slow on others.
    You can currently not get the help menu in the 256 color mode.

    Thanx... Vince Weaver

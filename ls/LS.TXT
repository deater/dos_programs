ls.... another exciting VMW software production.

This program (ls.exe) and the included source (ls.pas) emulate the
Unix command of the same name.  It ignores all the formatting
switches however; it emulates an "ls -la" command.  The "lls.bat" file
included just pipes the output to the more command to make it more
readable.

When compiled, this program can be copied to a directory in the path
(i.e c:\dos) and then it can be run from anywhere.

Instead of making a clunky batchfile called ls, use this and feel 
sort of at home on a PC.

I wrote this program in Turbo Pascal 6.0, but I am sure it would
run on 5.x.  It should compile easily, once loaded into the editor.

Most dos wildcards work similar to the equivelant dir command.

For example:   ls *.exe   is equivelant to   dir *.exe
               ls c:*.bat is equivelant to   dir c:*.exe
               ls h.??u   is equivelant to   dir h.??u

The way it works:
  Using pascal all of the attribute bits are detected through dos.
  If a file is read only, then it is displayed as such.  Same thing
  with the system attrubute.  Hidden files are shown with a period
  in front of them.  Any files ending in the extension bat, com,
  or exe are marked as executable.  Directories are marked as
  directories and executable.  The time and date format is exactly
  the same as an "ls -la" command on an SGI running Irix 5.3.  The
  main atttributes are replicated three times because of the lack
  of privledges.  The owner of file is always shown as "root" because
  on a PC everyone has root privledges.  The source code lacks 
  comments, but it should not be too difficult to follow.

This program is a freeware VMW software production.

This is an implementation of the UNIX (well, IRIX in this case)
"ls" command written in Pascal for DOS.

I made this because after a summer of using an IRIX machine I kept typing
ls on my family's DOS machine.

This was probably the first code I ever uploaded to the internet, I think
I uploaded it to SIMTEL or maybe SUNSITE in the 1995 timeframe.

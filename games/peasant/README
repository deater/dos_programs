FAQ:

	Q. Why is it slow in parts?

	A. Unlike the Apple II version which is written entirely in
		assembly language, a lot of the DOS version is written
		in Turbo Pascal (with inline assembly)


	Q. Why don't you write it all in assembly?

	A. While I can code x86 assembly I don't really enjoy it.
		Too much 6502 has spoiled me.


	Q. Why Pascal and not C?

	A. Pascal is what I coded all of my DOS games in back in the
		1990s (well, after I had moved on from GW-BASIC and QBasic)


	Q. Why are you compiling with Turbo Pascal and not
		Lazarus/FreePascal?

	A. Currently I have a Makefile that launches a DOSbox script
		that runs TPC.EXE and compiles things.  I could probably
		set up a full Linux toolchain but for now this works.
